  To leave indication on web, I, on behalf of Ferveyes Ltd, am writing this words to explain my huge mistake.
  I applied to Microsoft reseller program (direct model) but it was mistake that I didn't check all of details about terms and conditions.
  I still don't understand whole picture of it, I'm really scared that the program is probably huge overspec for my company.
  It was done last a couple of hours while I was lost way in complecated Microsoft web site. By call from US, my thinking has started.
  From now on (and last 1 hour), I'm going to try to reach out valid place to explain that I don't want to join it anymore (at least I completely understand what I'm doing and whether it is exactly what I want to do).
  I'm really serious and my hands have been vibrate since I found my mistake......
